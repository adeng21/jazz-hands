Nia Lister,Nia," I’ve been on my own since I was 15, and I’ve learned a lot about people and what I want. I have a lot to offer and I intend to do great things. I may not have what most people would call home, but I have people to stay with. I’m lucky for that but that’s not how I want it to stay. What I really need is an education so I can be who I am meant to be: independent and able to take care of myself.
